tubemarks mod system
====================

The mod system will bring the good stuff to the top and push down the crap.

1. a user can mod any video (1-5)
2. unmodded videos will be 2.5 by default
3. a videos mod score will be the average of all mod scores
4. videos will be listed in order of their mod

5. your friends mod values for a video will be weighted
the weighting means that even if 90% of people modded a video
down it will appear higher if your friends liked it (and vice versa).

I don't like guitar hero personally but know a lot of people will like it.
I should have the option of ignoring their mods if I want.

Yep, you should.

So basically i can go to tubemarks and see the videos my friends are watching. 
Which are videos I will like ~ cos my friends have similar interests to me.
Tubemarks knows what videos i like! that's smarter than youtube! :-)
